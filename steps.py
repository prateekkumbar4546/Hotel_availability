1. Problem Understanding and Goal Definition
Clarify the business objective and metrics:
Identify the specific outcome the project aims to impact (e.g., improve retention, increase accuracy).
Determine evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, RMSE) aligned with the objective.
Formulate a hypothesis:
Develop initial ideas about potential factors or relationships in the data.
List assumptions and validate them during analysis.
  
2. Data Collection and Exploration
Gather and examine data:
Identify relevant data sources and import datasets.
Understand data types, ranges, and any potential constraints.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize distributions, trends, and relationships among features.
Identify outliers, missing values, and anomalies.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing and inconsistent data:
Impute missing values with suitable methods (mean, median, or domain knowledge).
Normalize or scale features if necessary for specific models.
Engineer features:
Generate new features, aggregate, or transform existing ones.
Reduce dimensionality using techniques like PCA if needed.

4. Model Selection and Training
Select appropriate algorithms:
Choose models based on data type, size, and business requirements (e.g., interpretability).
Use baseline models first, then iterate with more complex ones if needed.
Train and optimize models:
Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
Tune hyperparameters using methods like cross-validation or grid search.

5. Evaluation and Validation
Assess model performance:
Use the chosen metrics to evaluate performance on validation and test sets.
Compare results across models and check for overfitting or underfitting.
Validate with business metrics and assumptions:
Ensure results are meaningful and actionable for the business.
Re-evaluate assumptions and performance to refine as needed.

6. Deployment and Monitoring
Prepare model for production:
Package model and create a reproducible pipeline (consider versioning).
Plan integration with the existing system or API.
Set up monitoring and feedback loop:
Track model performance over time and detect drift.
Continuously gather new data to retrain or improve the model.
